# 🔍 Python Port Scanner

A **Python-based Port Scanner** that scans all **65,535 ports** of a target IP and lists only truly **open ports** along with their service names. Ideal for **cybersecurity enthusiasts, ethical hackers, and penetration testers**.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Scans all 65,535 ports** efficiently  
✅ **Displays only open ports** (no false positives)  
✅ **Shows service names** (e.g., SSH, HTTP, FTP)  
✅ **Simple, lightweight, and accurate**  
✅ **Ideal for cybersecurity internships & projects**  

---

## 📌 Installation
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Then, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet or pip install pyfiglet --break-system-packages
sudo chmod +x port.py

## Run as root user
sudo python3 port.py

🔧 How It Works
The script loops through all 65,535 ports and attempts to connect.

If a port is open, it displays the port number and service name.

Closed ports are ignored, making the scan clean and accurate.

🛠️ Technologies Used
